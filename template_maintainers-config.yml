  ## Duties of a Maintainer

  Maintainers are responsible for the quality, security, and long-term health of
  this repository. Their responsibilities include:

  - Responding to and acting on reported security vulnerabilities.
  - Reviewing, providing feedback on, and merging or rejecting Pull Requests.
  - Reviewing, triaging, commenting on, and closing GitHub Issues.
  - Facilitating architectural or roadmap discussions when appropriate.
  - Creating, labeling, and prioritizing issues for contributors.
  - Maintaining CI/CD pipelines and ensuring reliable releases.
  - Participating in and executing release processes.
  - Keeping CONTRIBUTING.md and onboarding documentation up to date.
  - Contributing improvements via Pull Requests.
  - Aligning with organization-wide governance expectations.

  ## Becoming a Maintainer

  This community encourages contributors to grow into maintainers. The typical
  process is:

  1. Demonstrate sustained contribution to the project  
     (commonly ~5 significant merged PRs).
  2. Be nominated or self-nominate via a GitHub Issue, community meeting, or
     project communication channel.
  3. Confirm willingness to serve as a long-term maintainer (typically >6 months).
  4. Enter an approval period:
     - Announce the nomination broadly so community feedback may be provided.
  5. Approval occurs when:
     - Three maintainers approve and two weeks pass, **or**
     - An absolute majority approve.
  6. Follow the steps to [update the list of maintainers](#updating-the-list-of-maintainers).

  This ensures a transparent and consensus-driven onboarding process.

  ## Removing Maintainers

  Maintainers may transition to emeritus status for reasons including:

  - Voluntary resignation  
  - Inactivity (typically one quarter without contributions or reviews)  
  - Code of Conduct violations  
  - Other circumstances agreed upon by the maintainers

  The transition process is:

  1. Open an issue proposing the change.
  2. Obtain support from an existing maintainer or governance administrator.
  3. Enter an approval period (it may be announced publicly to solicit feedback).
  4. Transition occurs when:
     - The maintainer agrees, **or**
     - Three maintainers approve and two weeks pass, **or**
     - An absolute majority approve.
  5. Follow the steps to [update the list of maintainers](#updating-the-list-of-maintainers).


  Returning from emeritus status follows the same steps as becoming a maintainer.

  ## Updating the List of Maintainers

  The maintainer table in this file is generated from team definitions
  stored in the **{organization} {gov_org}**. This repository does *not* maintain
  its own list of maintainers; all membership lives centrally in the governance
  repostory of the **{organization}**.

  To change who appears in the Maintainers Table:

  - Follow the governance process for Adding or Removing maintainers, described
    above.
  - Once those steps are complete, make the corresponding technical change by
    submitting a Pull Request to update the governance YAML file:

    `{yaml_link}`

  After that PR is merged, this MAINTAINERS.md file will be automatically
  regenerated by the Maintainers Generator on its next run.

  ## Updating the Text in This File

  The text that appears **before and after** the Maintainers Table is also
  generated automatically. It is controlled through maintainer configuration
  file, located at the here:

  - `{maintainers_config_link}`
`
  A PR may be submitted to change the text in that file, impacting all
  repositories using that configuration. Do this if the change should apply
  broadly.

  If that file is **not** part of this repository, you can use the following steps
  to make repository- or project-specific changes to the content.

  1. Create a `.maintainers-config.yaml` file in the root of the repository.
     The file may have the full configuration information or may start with an
     `extends` directive to inherit from the existing configuration by specifying the URL:
     `{maintainers_config_link}` or a project-level maintainers configuration
     file. The location of the project-level file depends on your project's setup.
  2. The file may also contain any repo level overrides, such as
     updated `before_text` or `after_text` content.
  3. After the PR is merged, the Maintainers Generator will update this file
     automatically.

  See the documentation for the Maintainers Generator for additional details
  about configuration layering and template behavior.
