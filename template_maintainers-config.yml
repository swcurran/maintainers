  ## Updating the Maintainers List

  The maintainers table above is derived from team definitions stored in the  
  **{organization} {gov_org}**. To update team membership:

  1. Edit the appropriate team(s) in the Governance Repository configuration file:  
     [{yaml_link}]({yaml_link}) in the GitHub user interface or in a
     fork of the repository.
  2. Create a Pull Request with the proposed changes.
  3. Get PR approvals or supportive comments on the PR from existing maintainers.
  4. After the PR is merged, this MAINTAINERS.md file will be updated automatically
     during the next generator run.

  Those are the mechanical steps to manage the maintainers teams and roles. The
  sections below define maintainer *governance*.

  ## Duties of a Maintainer

  Maintainers are responsible for the quality, security, and long-term health of this repository.
  They are expected to:

  - Respond to and act on security vulnerabilities.
  - Review, provide feedback on, and merge or reject Pull Requests.
  - Review, triage, comment on, and close GitHub Issues.
  - Facilitate architectural or roadmap discussions when appropriate.
  - Create and label issues for contributors.
  - Maintain CI/CD and release pipelines.
  - Participate in release processes.
  - Maintain CONTRIBUTING.md and onboarding documentation.
  - Contribute improvements via Pull Requests.
  - Stay aligned with project-wide or foundation-wide governance expectations.

  ## Becoming a Maintainer

  This community encourages contributors to grow into maintainers.
  To become a maintainer:

  1. Demonstrate ongoing contributions to the project  
     (generally ~5 significant merged PRs).
  2. Self-nominate or be nominated by an existing maintainer in a meeting, via a GitHub issue or in a community chat.
  3. The prospective maintainer must confirm their willingness to serve long-term (typically >6 months).
  4. After nomination, an approval period begins:
     - Announce the nomination in appropriate communication channels.
     - Encourage community feedback.
  6. Approval occurs when:
     - Three maintainers approve and two weeks pass, **or**
     - An absolute majority approve.
  7. Once approved, update the team membership via a PR to the Governance
  Repository as per the [updating the maintainers list process](#updating-the-maintainers-list-process).

  This file will update automatically after that PR is merged.

  ## Removing Maintainers

  Maintainers may transition to emeritus status for reason including:

  - Voluntary resignation  
  - Inactivity (typically one quarter without contributions or reviews)  
  - Code of Conduct violations  
  - Other circumstances deemed appropriate by the maintainers

  The removal process:

  1. Open an issue proposing the transition.
  2. Obtain support from an existing maintainer or governance administrator.
  3. The approval period begins and may be communicated publicly.
  4. Transition occurs when:
     - The maintainer agrees, **or**
     - Three maintainers approve and two weeks pass, **or**
     - An absolute majority approve.
  5. Update team membership via a PR to the Governance Repository.

  Returning from emeritus status follows the same steps as becoming a maintainer.
